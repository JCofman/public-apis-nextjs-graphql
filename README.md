# Public Graphql API for Public APIs

The project is a Graphql wrapper around the awesome [Public API](https://github.com/davemachado/public-api) project. You can open the Graphql Playground [here](https://public-apis.jcofman.de/api/graphql).

This project uses [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app with typescript and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) as a Graphql layer.
